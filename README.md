# The command line creed

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

My dotfiles are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my life.

Without me, git and vim are useless. Without git and vim, I am useless. I must type in my teminal emulator true (and often false as well). I must type better code than my competitors who are trying to terk my jerb. I must code the things before my competitor does. I will...

My dotfiles and I know that what counts at work are not the characters we type, the clicks we click nor the lame jokes we make. We know that working shit is what counts. I will write working shit...

My dotfiles are human, even as I, because they are my life. Thus, I will update them every so often. I will learn their weaknesses, their strength, their files, their apis, their hotkeys and their shortcuts. I will keep my code clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...

Before Rngesus I swear this creed. My dotfiles and I are the defenders of my command line. We are the masters of efficiency. We are the saviors of mouse clicks.

So be it, until every device is posix compliant and there is no gui, only tmux.
